# data structures
Using different data structures to solve problems
## quicksort
Uses a dateSort() function to sort an array of dates using the quicksort method. The main() function reads an array of dates and outputs the sorted array of dates.
## hash table
Uses a hash table to implement a cache.
- cache(int capacity): initialize cache with positive size capacity
- int get(int key): return value of the key if it exists, otherwise return 1
- void put(int key, int value): update vale of key if it exists, otherwise add key-value pair to cache. If number of keys is greater than the capacity from this operation, evict the least recently used key.
## mothVex
Using a function mothVex(), find a mother vertex in a graph and output it
- If the mother vertex of the graph does not exist, output -1
- If there are multiple mother vertices, output all of them
